Functionalities
===============

Here, we describe some functionalities.

V-representation
----------------

For polytopes, we can have different representations. To go from H-representation to V-representation, we must solve the linear program given by

.. math:: min_{\bm{x}} \bm{A} \bm{x} \leq \bm{b} \quad \text{subject to} \quad \bm{F} \bm{x} = \bm{g}.
