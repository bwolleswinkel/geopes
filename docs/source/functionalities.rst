Functionalities
===============

Here, we describe some functionalities.

V-representation
----------------

For polytopes, we can have different representations. To go from H-representation to V-representation, we must solve the linear program given by

.. math:: \min_{\boldsymbol{x}} \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{x} \leq \boldsymbol{b} \quad \text{subject to} \quad \boldsymbol{F} \boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{g}.
