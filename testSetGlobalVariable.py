"""Example script to demonstrate how `mp.set_tol` acts as a global setter and context manager. Note that, for implementation, we actually would need to split the following into three files: `config.py`, `mypackage.py`, and `main.py`. However, for demonstration purposes, we keep everything in one file here.
